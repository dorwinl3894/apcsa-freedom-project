### Update
My partner, Alex, and I have been tinkering with a lot of stuff in the past four weeks including three.js, typescript, java, javascript, c++, tinkercad, and blender. We have finally decided on something to make and it involves using Three.js , which is a javascript framework for creating web based games, Typescript for back end servers, and blender for 3D models. 

### Sources I am using for this project. 
For this project, I will be focusing all of my attention on learning Blender and Three.js. I have found many useful sources to learn both Blender and Three.js. Most of my sources are from Youtube because there are just a lot of it and you can ask questions on the comment if you have a question that the creator of the tutorial might be able to answer. 
For Blender, I am currently learning through these sources.
