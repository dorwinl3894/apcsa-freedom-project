### Update

I have been learning a lot about Blender through tinkering with the application as well as watching videos and searching up tutorials online. My partner and I have been having conversations about the game and its design. 

### What I have been using for the project.      

Blender is a very complex tool that can do a lot of things. What I have currently achieved with blender is creating simple designs using multiple types of objects known as mesh objects. Exmaples of mesh objects include Cubes, Spheres, Cylinders, Planes, and Cones. In entry #3, I said that I was using a few youtube blender tutorial playlists to teach me the basics of blender and modeling. After watching most of the videos, I am now confident in creating simple models that can be used in the prototype of the game.

Both of the basic models shown above were both created individually within one hour. To create more complex models, I would need to invest a lot more time into it, but that would only be for the final product. For now, I am still learning how to use other advanced tools in Blender to make finer details of the model such as [Low Poly Modelling](https://medium.com/@Fahmiza/beginners-tutorial-for-low-poly-design-in-blender-311cefcaf0ab). 

### Engineering design Process     
My partner and I are at step five of the Engineering Design Process. As I continue creating prototypes of the models that will be used in the game, my partner will be setting up the game using Three.js and html.
