### Update

I have been learning a lot about Blender through tinkering with the application as well as watching videos and searching up tutorials online. My partner and I have been having conversations about the game and its design. 

### What I have been using for the project.

Blender is a very complex tool that can do a lot of things. What I have currently achieved with blender is creating simple designs using multiple types of objects known as mesh objects. Exmaples of mesh objects include Cubes, Spheres, Cylinders, Planes, and Cones.
