#### Overview
  My partner and I have decided to commit to making our web based game, which will be hosted in our current website name, swizzy.xyz. 
  
#### Why are we making this?
  Unfortunately, there are very few web based racing games that are good in the web. While searching the web for a car racing game that had good, simple graphics, and a clear gameplay, we only found a few, but none of them were perfect. Fortunately, my partner and I found the opportunitiy to make a racing game to satisfy the niche that was left unfilled until now. A web based racing game that had great graphics, easy on the computer to handle, and fun gameplay.
