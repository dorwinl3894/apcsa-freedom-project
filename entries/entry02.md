#### Overview
  My partner and I have decided to commit to making our web based game, which will be hosted in our current website name, swizzy.xyz.

#### Why are we making this?
  Unfortunately, there are very few web based racing games that are good in the web. While searching the web for a car racing game that had good, simple graphics, and a clear gameplay, we only found a few, but none of them were perfect. Fortunately, my partner and I found the opportunitiy to make a racing game to satisfy the niche that was left unfilled until now. A web based racing game that had great graphics, easy on the computer to handle, and fun gameplay.

#### Coming up with a blueprint
  The gameplay of the web based game will be played using a keyboard and a mouse. Although my partner and I do not have the final decisions for the controls of the game, we have decided to use four keys to control the movement of the car ingame, "W" , "A" , "S" , and "D". These four letters will allow the users car to drift up, left , down, and right respectively.

  We have also gained motivation from a unique web demo , [infinitown](https://demos.littleworkshop.fr/infinitown) because of its good, simple graphics that we wanted to have in our game.

#### Tinkering
  My partner and I are both working on the gameplay of the game using three.js. Three.js is a javascript library that focuses on creating and displaying animated 3D graphics onto a web browser. The capabilities of three.js includes making games, making 3D interactive objects, and 3D large-scaled models.
  My partner has a focus on the backend aspects of the game, while I am learning the fundamentals of three.js to allow myself to be comfortable coding with three.js and Javascript in general.
  We are using a shared workspace using Visual Studio Code with a remote repository using Github.
