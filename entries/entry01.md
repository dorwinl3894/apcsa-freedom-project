### Motivation

My partner Alex Yu and I are long time game enthusiasts, playing a variety of games ranging from mobile to computer to console games. We have decided to make a mobile game using Unity's 2D game engine.

### About the game

The game will be a multiplayer survival game with character movements and a lot of interactivitiy between the players and the game. So far, we have decided for the game to have features including singleplayer and team modes.

### Knowledge Needed

We need to learn how to use Unity and be comfortable with the basics of game development. Since Unity uses C#, my partner and I will need to learn how to code in this language comfortably. Additionaly, since the game is
2D, we also need to learn how to make 2D models through Unity. The last thing we will need to learn how to do is create a backend server to allow for the multiplayer aspect of the game to happen.
