### Motivation

My partner Alex Yu and I are long time game enthusiasts, playing a variety of games ranging from mobile to computer to console games. We have decided to make a mobile game using Unity's 2D game engine.

### About the game

The game will be a multiplayer survival game with character movements and a lot of interactivitiy between the players and the game.

### Knowledge Needed

We need to learn how to use Unity and be comfortable with the basics of game development. Since Unity uses C#, my partenr and I will need to learn how to code in this language comfortably. Additionaly, since the game is
2D, we also need to learn how to make 2D models through Unity.
